# Stay in the norms

My entry for Pygame Community Spring Jam 2024, where the theme was "Temperature".

I didn't have enough time to polish it, and I don't think you will have fun playing it, 
but still, I was really happy while developing it, so I guess it's the most important! 

## Background

You control a cell, that's quite sensitive regarding its temperature... You enjoy to be on the perfect spot, and
any too big divergence from it can be fatal.
Unfortunately, your world is quite gloomy: other cells keep rushing into you, and of course, they are not as temperate as you.
So your life can be sum up at dodging these cells, for the shake of your *temperature sanity*.

## Controls

S/F or arrows to move.
Seems easy, right?
